            <p class="text-content">With the sting of the handle breaking during the investor meeting the first handle I designed was beefy to say the least, we wanted to be sure that wouldn't happen again. We settled on combining the previous design of the three gimbal but include a custom half circle ring that could move and spin. This handle prototype was the result of several lengthy meeting, about two weeks of design & analysis, plus several weeks to have the parts machined and assembled.

                I don't have many images of this version of the attachment becuase we quickly realized it would not work as we hoped but the half circle ring was a new idea that we believed had potentail and warranted further exploration.

            We realized that a deliberate design process with lots of discussion, ideation, and analysis up front wasn't going to find a solution. To speed up the development process I started kit bashing all of the different handle components we had to build prototypes as quickly as possible. This methodology of quickly building prototypes instead of spending hours discussing hypotheticals became the cornerstone of our development process.

                <p>We started to realize that we didn't need full freedom of motion on all axis. We limited the grip rotation so the slewing bearing would not be able to slap the users wrist while still allowing for natuaral movement.</p>

        <p class="text-content">The problem we were having was that the outer ring would get stuck at the ends of the movement so to return the outer ring to the center where it would be ready for the next movement was to add extension springs. This was a game changer. Now the handle wouldn't get stuck in a certain position, it allowed for fluid, natural, movement without snagging.

Through all of our testing we never determined that this was dangerous, only annoying. We were never able to find a way to mechanically resolve that issue so we added padding to the outer ring to protect the user in the event that it did swing around.

            <p class="text-content">As we developed more attachmnets it became more important for users to quickly swap from one attachment to another. Given my limited resources we decided that finding an off the shelf solution would be the fastest way to introduce this feature to customers. I discovered that hydraulic lines for high pressure systems used a quick connect mechanism that looked strong enough to handle the forces our handles go through.</p>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p class="text-content">At this point we started to understand that Proteus systems were being used by a growing number of top teir professional athletes and they were more interested in strength training and power metrics than fluid sport movements at lower resistances. As a result we needed an attachment that could handle the stresses of this new power use case as well as an attachment that was easier to manufacture. </p>    
                <p class="text-content">The covid pandemic was at its height, we had been kicked out of our office building and the maker space I used to build prototypes. To keep making progress I purchased a desktop CNC machine and built an enclsure so I could cut parts in my tiny Brooklyn apartment.</p>

        </div>

        <p class="text-content">So going back to some of our earliest ideas for attachments I designed a new bar-linakge handle. Using my little CNC machine I was able to assemble this early prototype for initial testing. Within the first day of testing we knew that this new design would be the way forward for the new power perfomace that our customers were looking for. </p>

        <p>With users putting that much power into the system there was no way my inital design would be able to withstand that level of strain.</p>
