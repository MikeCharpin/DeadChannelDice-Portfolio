This was with the very first version of the Proteus System, developed by the founders father while at MIT.

        <div class="bio-section">
            <p class="bio-content">At this point we believed that this design was the path forward. We had tested the handle in-house as well with a college baseball team and found that it accomplished our goals of allowing for natural feeling sport specific movements at low to medium resistance of 5lbs to 20lbs. </p>    
            <p class="bio-content">
                That being said the attachment wasn't perfect but compared to all the other versions that came before it this one showed a lot of promise and the problems were managable or circumstantial.  
            </p>

                <p class="bio-content">
                    Problems to solve:
                </p>
                <li class="bio-content">- There were certain circular wrist motions that would cause the outer ring to swing around and smack the users wrist. Through all of our testing we never determined that this was dangerous, only annoying. We were never able to find a way to mechanically resolve that issue so we resolved to adding padding to the outer ring to protect the user in the event that it did swing around. 
                
                <li class="bio-content">- The sounds of the springs stretching and hitting the outer ring sounded “old-timey” and didn’t match the rest of the machine. 
                
                <li class="bio-content">- Durability. Given the new type of resistance and the fluid motions we were looking for we found that if the handle was too heavy it made the machine feel unwieldy so we needed to keep the handle as light as possible while also being able to withstand the abuse of athletic training. This will turn out to be significanly more difficult than initially anticipated.

            <p class="bio-content">At this point we started to understand that Proteus systems were being used by a growing number of top teir professional athletes and they were more interested in strength training and power metrics than fluid sport movements at lower resistances. As a result we needed an attachment that could handle the stresses of this new power use case as well as an attachment that was easier to manufacture. </p>    
            <p class="bio-content">The covid pandemic was at its height, we had been kicked out of our office building and the maker space I used to build prototypes. To keep making progress I purchased a desktop CNC machine and built an enclsure so I could cut parts in my tiny Brooklyn apartment.</p>

    </div>

    <p class="bio-content">So going back to some of our earliest ideas for attachments I designed a new bar-linakge handle. Using my little CNC machine I was able to assemble this early prototype for initial testing. Within the first day of testing we knew that this new design would be the way forward for the new power perfomace that our customers were looking for. </p>

    <p>With users putting that much power into the system there was no way my inital design would be able to withstand that level of strain.</p>
