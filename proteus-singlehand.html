I came onboard to design a single hand attachment that would allow for comfortable freedom of motion while performing sport movements.

        <p class="bio-content">The existing three attachments each had problems that made using Proteus uncomfortable and unpredictable. When I first joined we used a snowboarding mitten as protection for when the handles would snap over during cross planar movements.

This explained the locking sensation and the resulting "snap" we would feel when we broke through the "lock". My goal for the next prototype attachment was to include an additional axis of freedom to avoid gimbal lock. </p>

            <p class="bio-content">Fun Fact: During the Apollo 11 mission the engineers knew gimbal lock was a problem for the IMU but decided the current 3 gimbal system was sufficient. During the moon landing astronaut Mike Collins grew frustrated by the handicap of the 3 gimbal system and joked "How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas?". All following NASA IMU systems used a 4 gimbal system.</p>

                </p>
                <li class="bio-content"><strong>Padding - </strong> There were certain circular wrist motions that would cause the outer ring to swing around and smack the users wrist. Through all of our testing we never determined that this was dangerous, only annoying. We were never able to find a way to mechanically resolve that issue so we added padding to the outer ring to protect the user in the event that it did swing around. 
                </li>
                
                <li class="bio-content"><strong>Springs - </strong>The sounds of the springs stretching and hitting the outer ring sounded “old-timey” and did not match the design language for the vision of the Proteus system.
                </li>

                <li class="bio-content"><strong>Mounting -</strong> How the handle was mounted to the system needed to be easier for users to quickly swap out attachments. 
                </li>

                <li class="bio-content"><strong>Durability - </strong>The new type of resistance and the fluid motions we were looking for we found that if the handle was too heavy it made the machine feel unwieldy so we needed to keep the handle as light as possible while also being able to withstand the abuse of athletic training. This will turn out to be significanly more difficult than initially anticipated.
