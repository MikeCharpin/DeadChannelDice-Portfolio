                    <p class="text-area">The goal of the Proteus system was to be a rehabilitation tool that uses the novel type of resistance to help people more quickly recover from injuries. I came onboard to design a single hand attachment that would allow for comfortable freedom of motion while performing sport movements.</p>

                    <p class="text-area">The existing three attachments each had problems that made using Proteus uncomfortable and unpredictable. When I first joined we used a snowboarding mitten as protection for when the handles would snap over during cross planar movements.</p>

This methodology of quickly building prototypes instead of spending hours discussing hypotheticals became the cornerstone of our development process.</p>

                    <p class="text-area">The Proteus system was also rapidly evolving at this point. The new system was significantly lighter so the handles didn't need to be as over built as the original designs. </p>
